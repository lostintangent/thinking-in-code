# üß† Thinking in Code

<ins>Premise:</ins> [Writing is thinking](https://alistapart.com/article/writing-is-thinking/). [Thinking is learning](http://worrydream.com/#!/LearnableProgramming). [Learning is doing](https://blog.ncase.me/curse-of-the-chocolate-covered-broccoli-or-emotion-in-learning/) 

_Thinking in Code_ is a curated set of VS Code extensions, which collectively seek to provide a <ins>learning environment</ins> that can improve the comprehension & interactivity of code, support the management of code-centric [knowledge bases](https://thesweetsetup.com/pkm-intro-for-creatives/) / [digital gardens](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history/), and help developers "think better" as part of their daily routine. Maybe, just maybe, it can help make your development experience more fun üé¢

## üßë‚Äçü§ù‚Äçüßë [Think Different](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Think_different), [But Together](http://aka.ms/vsls-why)

While thinking requires focus, learning can benefit from collaboration with others. As a result, every extension in this collection is collaborative by default, and provides rich integration with [Live Share](https://aka.ms/vsls) (real-time co-editing and debugging for VS Code). This makes it easy to incorporate these writing/thinking experiences into your existing [collaborative workflows](https://aka.ms/vsls-usecases). 

| Extension | Collaborative experience |
|-|-|
| CodeTour | When you start or navigate a tour, all participants will automatically follow along with you. |
| CodeSwing | When you open a swing, all participants will automatically open the same one. This allows you to share and co-edit a swing as a real-time collaborative playground.
