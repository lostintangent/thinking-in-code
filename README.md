# 🧠 Thinking in Code

[Writing is thinking](https://alistapart.com/article/writing-is-thinking/). [Thinking is learning](http://worrydream.com/#!/LearnableProgramming). [Learning is doing](https://blog.ncase.me/curse-of-the-chocolate-covered-broccoli-or-emotion-in-learning/) 🙌

_Thinking in Code_ is a collection of extensions for VS Code, which seeks to provide an environment that improves the comprehension and interactivity of code, supports the creation of code-centric "knowledge bases", and hopefully, makes learning a natural part of our everyday lives.

### Included Extensions

- 🗺️ [CodeTour](https://aka.ms/codetour) - Record and playback guided tutorials for codebases. It's like a table-of-contents for projects, and helps walk developers members through a codebase, directly from the comfort of their editor.

- 📘 [GistPad](https://aka.ms/gistpad) - Create and edit GitHub Gists and repos, directly from the editor, and without needing to clone anything.

- 💃 [CodeSwing](https://aka.ms/codeswing) - An interactive coding environment for building web applications playgrounds (aka "swings").

- 📄 [GitDoc](https://aka.ms/gitdoc) - Edit a local Git repo like a multi-file, versioned document. Auto-commit your changes, easily manage history, and keep your changes in sync, without needing to care about the Git CLI at all!
