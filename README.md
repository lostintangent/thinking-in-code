# üß† Thinking in Code

[Writing is thinking](https://alistapart.com/article/writing-is-thinking/). [Thinking is learning](http://worrydream.com/#!/LearnableProgramming). [Learning is doing](https://blog.ncase.me/curse-of-the-chocolate-covered-broccoli-or-emotion-in-learning/) üôå

_Thinking in Code_ is a curated collection of VS Code extensions, which seeks to provide a <ins>learning environment</ins> that can improve the comprehension & interactivity of code, support the management of code-centric "knowledge bases" / [digital gardens](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history/), and help developers "think better" as part of their daily routine üéì

## üßë‚Äçü§ù‚Äçüßë Collaborative by Default

While thinking requires focus, learning can benefit from collaboration with others. As a result, every extension in this collection is collaborative by default, and provides a rich integration with [Live Share](https://aka.ms/vsls). This makes it easy to extend your learning environment to others, and make the writing/thinking experiences a part of your [collaborative workflows](https//aka.ms/vsls-usecases). 

| Extension | Collaborative experience |
|-|-|
| CodeTour | When you start or navigate a tour, all participants will automatically follow along with you. |
| CodeSwing | When you open a swing, all participants will automatically open the same one. This allows you to share and co-edit a swing as a real-time collaborative playground.
